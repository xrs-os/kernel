## Build

### Environment

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) toolchain
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) >= 6.1.0
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)

### How to run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xrs-os/kernel.git
cd kernel
python3 bootstrap.py qemu
```


## Inspired by
- [rCore](https://github.com/rcore-os/rCore) Rust version of THU uCore OS, teaching operating system. Linux compatible.
- [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) An os blog. This blog series creates a small operating system in the Rust programming language.
- [Redox](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox) Redox is an operating system written in Rust, a language with focus on safety and high performance. Redox, following the microkernel design, aims to be secure, usable, and free.
- [xv6-riscv](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) xv6 is a teaching operating system developed for MIT's operating systems course. It is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.
